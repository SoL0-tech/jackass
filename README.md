# Jobjack Assessment AKA: Jackass

## Overview

This is an elegant (lol) solution to a coding assessment I was given.
It ain't pretty, but hopefully it demonstrates some good patterns and coding style.

Read the full specification [here](./spec.txt).

## Pre-requisites

+ `docker` and `docker-compose`

## Setup

1) `cd jackass`
2) `docker-compose up`
3) `Profit!`


Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see it in action.


**Notes:**
  + If we wanted to expose the local filesystem, we could mount `/` as a volume in the API's docker-compose section.

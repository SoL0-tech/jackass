1.) Develop a Node.JS restful api that allows a client app to:

Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem. 
Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result and cater for a 
large directory size ( at least 100 000).

Make sure the application is containerized and can run on any system.

2.) Build a Angular 6 client and can call the api and display the results. It does not have to be fancy, you can use frameworks like bootstrap to display the data.

3.) Try and stay away from imperative style coding as much as possible. Stream is you partner.

Submit this work on a github repo and share the repo.

Good luck.
